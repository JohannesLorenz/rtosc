RtOsc - Realtime safe OSC Messaging
===================================

A realtime safe library for handling OSC messages.
This library is influenced by liblo and libmapper.

Project Goals
-------------

* Provide a simple means of handling OSC messages within an application
* Provide a flexible method of dispatching OSC messages payloads
* Create a C library with C++ header only wrappers for ease of use
* Allow legacy code to have readable RT safe messaging added on
* Keep networking outside of project scope

Why?
----

Well if an application is going to receive nice serialized messages in the OSC format,
then it would be nice if these messages could be dispatched within a realtime
thread.
This is not possible with any observed C OSC implementation, so this is an
attempt to alleviate this issue without creating an entirely hideous API.

Status
------

- OSC 1.0 spec consistent implementation of floating point, strings, integers,
  blobs, true, false, and Nil.
- Somewhat non-conformant bundle implementation
- Working C++ based dispatch system

Todo
----

- Increase test coverage over C++ layer
- Implement rest of OSC message spec
- Formally specify C++ port strings
