RtOsc - A Bad Idea Brought To Life
==================================

A realtime safe library for handling OSC messages.
This library is influenced by liblo and libmapper.

Project Goals
-------------

* Provide a simple means of handling OSC messages within an application
* Provide a flexible method of dispatching OSC messages payloads
* Create a C library with C++ header only wrappers for ease of use
* Allow legacy code to have readable RT safe messaging added on
* Keep networking outside of project scope

Why?
----

Well if an application is going to receive nice serialized messages in the OSC format,
then it would be nice if these messages could be dispatched within a realtime
thread.
This is not possible with any observed C OSC implementation, so this is an
attempt to alleviate this issue without creating an entirely hideous API.

Status
------

- Self consistent implementation of floating point, strings, integers, blobs,
  true, false, and Nil.
- Working basic C++ based dispatch system
- Lots of bugs..

Todo
----

- Increase test coverage
- Implement rest of OSC message spec
- Create a truly unruly example by extending the "complex" one
- Add to the API to make the "simple" example very basic
